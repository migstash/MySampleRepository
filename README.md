# Lyrics: 
    Early morning, she wakes up
    Knock, knock, knock on the door
    It's time for make-up, perfect smile
    It's you they're all waiting for
    They go
    Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
    And they say
    She's so lucky, she's a star
    But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
    If there's nothing missing in my life
    Then why do these tears come at night?
