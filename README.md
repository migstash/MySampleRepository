# Lyrics: 
    Early morning, she wakes up
    Knock, knock, knock on the door
    It's time for make-up, perfect smile
    It's you they're all waiting for
    They go
    Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
    And they say
    She's so lucky, she's a star
    But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
    If there's nothing missing in my life
    Then why do these tears come at night?

# Lyrics: 
    tan ten tan ten tan ten tan ten A love no one could deny
    ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten I will always want you

    I came in like a wrecking ball
    I never hit so hard in love
    All I wanted was to break your walls
    All you ever did was wreck me
    Yeah, you, you wreck me
